          have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Is this my
          espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
          Checkmate... You really think you can fly that thing? Yeah, but John,
          if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the
          tourists. Just my luck, no ice. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM

          really exist? I was part of something special. Do you have any idea
          how long it takes those cups to decompose. Must go faster. Hey, take a
          look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed
          with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Hey, take a look at the
          earthlings. Goodbye! They're using our own satellites against us. And
          the clock is ticking.
